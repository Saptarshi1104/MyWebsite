<p id="meaning"> I am Saptarshi Mandal.I raed in class 5.My hobby is gardening.So here are a few words about gardening and why I like it!
Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings with one or more different types of shrubs, trees, and herbaceous plants, to residential back gardens including lawns and foundation plantings, and to container gardens grown inside or outside. Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve a variety of plants in mixed plantings. It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from farming or forestry.</p>

<p id="bio"> I like gardening because I can spend lots of time among trees.Whenever I get some leisure time I rush to the garden and enjoy the lush greenery of the plants and trees.I water the plants daily.Also while I am in the garden few cats come and I also play with them.Everyday several flowers bloom.Sometimes more than 50!But my favourite plant among all of them is the recently bought STRAWBERRY plant.It's hardly a month old,and the most beautifu thing about it is its beautifully shaped leaves.But the oldest trees are 2 christmas trees which are 20 years of age.Among those 100 plants and trees there are 24 rose plants.</p>
